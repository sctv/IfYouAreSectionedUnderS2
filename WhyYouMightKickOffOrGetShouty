Reasons I have seen that causes clients(including myself) to kick off(get shouty) are: 
- not giving us the right tewmperature water for tea
- not allowing us outside for a bit of fresh air / smoke(not that I do smoke)
- general tiredness
- general pain
- triggered paranoia
- someone getting que jumping
- seeing others enjoy things I dont have access to  (money/cash/fast/food/music machine/riding/church)
